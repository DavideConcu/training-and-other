    "Use this notebook in conjunction with Activity 5.5 Open photometry results in Python and Activity 6.4 Generate CMDs\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also wish to refer back to the Hyades_CMD notebook from Week 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is in two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first section you will import results from an AstroImageJ measurements file and inspect the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second section you will use Eq 3.1b to calculate magnitudes and then plot the CMD.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Data inspection\n",
    "The photometry in AstroimageJ produces a file containing the relative fluxes of the target stars, together with some other information. The default name for this file is Measurements.xls. In spite of the .xls extension this is actually a text file, similar to a .csv file but with fields separated by tabs rather than commas. After completing Activity 5.4 you will have a measurements file containing the results from your aperture photometry of the two images of M13 from the sample dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can read this file using Pandas in the same way as a .csv file, but specifying \\t as the separator to denote a tab-delimited file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AstroImageJ measurements file contains some columns of data (rel_flux_err) that are not needed. Pandas allows us to specify which columns to import, using a helper function that returns True to include a column, and False to exclude a column. Refer back to the UsingPandas notebook from Skills week 1 as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also uses regular expressions to identify the rows in the data file that contain values from the B and V filters. Refer to the UsingRegex notebook from the Skills weeks for information on using Regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell contains an example program that carries out the necessary steps to import the data from your measurements file. Modify this as necessary (for instance, if your file has a different name) and work through the steps making sure that you understand how it works. Use the commented-out print(...) statements to inspect the format of the data file at each step.\n"
